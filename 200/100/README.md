# 100 Gesture Basics #1: Line of Action

Based on "Gesture Basisc #1: Line of Action" at https://line-of-action.com/article/gesture-basics-1-line-of-action/

Whether from life or from imagination, the first mark made in most figure drawings is the line of action. You can think of the line of action as an imaginary line that runs down the spine. The more curve you put into that line, the more attitude, force and/or movement the image will communicate to your viewers.

When drawing from life, begin by finding the line of action and noting it down. If you wish, you may even exaggerate the curve of the line to make the pose feel less stiff. You should be able to identify and record a pose's line of action in the first 2 seconds of your drawing.

Here are some possible lines of action. Note that they are ***curves***, but they are ***not S shaped or squiggles***.

Some artists make two lines of action -- one for the body, and one for the arms. Either way, it is an essential tool for starting your image with an overall assessment of the pose and direction you wish to communicate, before getting bogged down in other details.

Once you have established the line of action, it becomes easier to compose dynamic, expressive poses by "hanging" the torso and hips along this line.

***The Line of Action, Make Your Character Poses More Dynamic!***

The line of action is a key ingredient to making your character's poses look more dynamic. In this guide, we will explore what the line of action is and how it can be used to make your character poses come alive.

### What is the Line of Action

The line of action goes hand in hand with making a character's pose easier to read. Think of the line of action as an imaginary line running down a character's spine. The line of action is a curved line. Making the line of action curved, as opposed to drawing it as a straight line, gives your character's pose more force and attitude which, in turn, aids in making your character's poses more visually interesting to the viewer.

***NOTE***: An optional second line of action is an imaginary line running from hand to hand of a character's arms.

The line of action is a simple curved line that evokes movement. Avoid making your line of action S-shaped or straight - it will hinder the overall force and make the resulting pose look less dynamic.
