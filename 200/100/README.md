# 100 Gesture Basics #1: Line of Action

Based on "Gesture Basisc #1: Line of Action" at https://line-of-action.com/article/gesture-basics-1-line-of-action/

Whether from life or from imagination, the first mark made in most figure drawings is the line of action. You can think of the line of action as an imaginary line that runs down the spine. The more curve you put into that line, the more attitude, force and/or movement the image will communicate to your viewers.

When drawing from life, begin by finding the line of action and noting it down. If you wish, you may even exaggerate the curve of the line to make the pose feel less stiff. You should be able to identify and record a pose's line of action in the first 2 seconds of your drawing.

Here are some possible lines of action. Note that they are ***curves***, but they are ***not S shaped or squiggles***.

Some artists make two lines of action -- one for the body, and one for the arms. Either way, it is an essential tool for starting your image with an overall assessment of the pose and direction you wish to communicate, before getting bogged down in other details.

Once you have established the line of action, it becomes easier to compose dynamic, expressive poses by "hanging" the torso and hips along this line.

***The Line of Action, Make Your Character Poses More Dynamic!***

By [Krishna M Sadasivam](https://tutsplus.com/authors/krishna-m-sadasivam)

The line of action is a key ingredient to making your character's poses look more dynamic. In this guide, we will explore what the line of action is and how it can be used to make your character poses come alive.

### What is the Line of Action

The line of action goes hand in hand with making a character's pose easier to read. Think of the line of action as an imaginary line running down a character's spine. The line of action is a curved line. Making the line of action curved, as opposed to drawing it as a straight line, gives your character's pose more force and attitude which, in turn, aids in making your character's poses more visually interesting to the viewer.

***NOTE***: An optional second line of action is an imaginary line running from hand to hand of a character's arms.

The line of action is a simple curved line that evokes movement. Avoid making your line of action S-shaped or straight - it will hinder the overall force and make the resulting pose look less dynamic.

Below are examples of poses utilizing a strong line of action. Note that even though the character may be standing "still", there is still an attitude being projected, simply by having the torso coincide with the line of action.

When drawing from life, find the line of action - note it down, and then proceed to exaggerate it. It'll make the resulting pose feel more "alive" and less stiff.

In the example below, we can see that as the line of action is made more horizontal, the character's run appears to be getting faster.

To give our character poses even more variety, we can twist the torso against the hips. By "breaking the plane", we automatically add depth to a pose. Coupled with rendering foreshortened elements of the body, the possibilities are endless.

## Two Can Technique

Based on "Learn to Draw Dynamic Comic Characters using The "Two Can" Technique!" at https://design.tutsplus.com/articles/learn-to-draw-dynamic-comic-characters-using-the-two-can-technique--vector-6034?_ga=2.141122034.1131517401.1603372015-1326149362.1603372015

Just like the line of action, the "two can" technique is another key ingredient in making exciting, dynamic character poses. In this guide, we will build on the line of action by adding the "two can" technique to create your comic character poses.

### What is the "Two Can" Technique?

The "two can" technique consists of treating both the shoulders and pelvis as cylinders, each placed at either end of the established line of action.

Start off by drawing the line of action. Next, draw two cylinders, one at either end on the line of action.

### Creating a Dynamic Pose

The "two cans" approach takes into account that each cylinder has two degrees of movement: lateral and vertical. In the lateral approach, both the shoulders and pelvis can rotate approximately 45 degrees around the line of action. In the vertical approach, the shoulders and pelvis can tilt up or down by roughly 45 degrees.

The best dynamic poses involve a combination of both lateral and vertical positions for both "cans". By adding a twist to your character's pose, your drawing gains more dimension.

In addition to rotating both "cans", you can also adjust their relative proximity to one another.

### Drawing Different Body Types

Varying the size of each "can", as shown in the figure below, will also yield uniquely proportioned character body shapes. Muscular characters may have a larger "can" representing their shoulders and a smaller "can" for their pelvis.

Heavier characters would have the opposite configuration.

A shapely woman will have their shoulder and hips at 45 degree angles counter to each other, with the hips larger than the shoulders, as shown below:
